00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:18,812
No‚ no‚ no‚ no‚ no no

2
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,917
No‚ no‚ no‚ no‚ no no

3
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:34,902
Light a blunt up with the flame

4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,209
Put that cocaine on a plate

5
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:40,014
Molly with the purple rain

6
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:42,901
′Cause I lost my faith

7
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,614
So I cut away the pain

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,211
Got it swimming in my veins

9
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,908
Now my mind is outta place‚ yeah

10
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:54,003
′Cause I lost my faith

11
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:56,852
And I feel everything

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,499
I feel everything from
my body to my soul

13
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,714
No‚ no

14
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:07,763
Well‚ I feel everything

15
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:13,410
When I am coming down is
the most I feel alone

16
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:16,263
No‚ no

17
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:19,114
I have been sober for a year‚
now It is time for me

18
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:21,817
To go back to my old ways‚
don′t you cry for me

19
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,458
Thought I had be a better man‚
but I lied to me and to you

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,699
I take half a Xan′ and
I still stay awake

21
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,418
All my demons wanna pull
me to my grave

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,909
I choose Vegas if they
offer Heaven′s gate

23
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,706
I tried to love‚ but you
know I had never stay

24
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,003
I had never stay

25
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:42,506
But if I OD‚ I want you
to OD right beside me

26
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,707
I want you to follow right behind me

27
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:47,810
I want you to hold me
while I am smiling

28
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:49,017
While I am dying

29
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:50,314
And if you know me

30
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:53,413
When I go missing‚ you know
where to find me

31
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:56,216
Driving down the boulevard is blinding

32
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,403
Always blinded by the
desert lights and

33
00:01:58,517 --> 00:01:59,416
I am alive when

34
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:02,515
I feel everything

35
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,918
I feel everything from
my body to my soul

36
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,611
No‚ no

37
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,418
Girl‚ I feel everything

38
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:18,915
When I am coming down is
the most I feel alone

39
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:21,314
No‚ no

40
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,501
I lost my faith

41
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:30,312
I am losing my religion every day

42
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:35,411
Time hasn′t been kind to me‚ I pray

43
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:40,700
When I look inside the mirror
and see someone I love

44
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:44,113
Oh‚ someone I love

45
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,704
Faith

46
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:52,203
I am losing my religion every day

47
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:57,304
Time hasn′t been kind to me‚ I pray

48
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,809
When I look inside the mirror
and see someone I love

49
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:06,300
Oh‚ someone I love

50
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:47,415
I ended up in the back
of a flashing car

51
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:53,312
With the city shining on my face

52
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:59,605
The lights are blinding me again

53
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:09,410
I ended up in the back
of a flashing car

54
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,009
With the city shining on my face

55
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:21,500
The lights are blinding me again

56
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:36,801
I ended up (I ended up)‚ in
the back of a flashing car
(Back of a flashing car)
